# Getting started

Welcome to the **Sisyphus library**, a C low-level library for a vulkan renderer.

This document will help you getting started with the library and will show you examples of how to make your own software with it.

The current version target only Linux with wayland but we're looking forward to make it available on Windows and X11.

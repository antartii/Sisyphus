# Contributing

There is only 2 way to contribute, work or helping the ones that work.

## Working on Sisyphus
**[Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus)** is an old tale from the greek mythology about a guy punished for having escaped death multiple time. I won't tell you the story again but this myth is in a way a representation of this project. Every time you take a step back from your computer, do a little pause or taking a nap, you'll see more and more that there is always something better to make, more efficient, a better architecture, a new feature, cool tools to work better.

**The only thing you should remember we're not here to do a better library than the one existing but we're here to improve as much as we can learning by our mistakes**

Trials and errors are part of the process and we want to use the least amount of external library as possible, for educational purposes and for fun.

And also to piss off vibe coders.

Now that you have that in mind you should be ready, when contributing you should always follow thoses steps :
- Create a new branch from the main branch or another branch
- Code your part of the library
- Before merging, make sure to follow every rules that can be applied to your work in [Release](Release.md)
- Submit a pull request detailing the changes made (read the release notes part in [Release](Release.md))
